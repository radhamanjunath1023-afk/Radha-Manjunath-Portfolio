## 🚀 Client Intake & Research Automation
This project automates the manual work of researching new leads. It takes a Tally form submission and turns it into a detailed "Executive Briefing" using AI.

## 📋 How It Works (Step-by-Step)
* **New Lead Entry:** The process starts automatically when a client fills out an intake form (via a Webhook).
* **Data Preparation:** The system cleans and organizes the form data so the AI can understand it clearly.
* **AI Research (Google Gemini):**
   * The AI uses Google Search to look up the client's company and recent news.
   * It analyzes the findings to identify key opportunities or pain points.
* **Information Formatting:** To keep things organized, the system forces the AI to present its findings in a clean, consistent structure (using an Output Parser).
* **Instant Notification:** A summary email is sent via Gmail, giving the team a "head start" before their first meeting with the client.
